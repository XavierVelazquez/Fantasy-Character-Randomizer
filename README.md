# Fantasy Character Randomizer!
This a python script to randomly generate a basic roleplaying character. 
It is currently based around the 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.
The script will prompt for a character name then output a random race, class, and background as well as rolling 6 ability scores.

# Functionality:
  Ability Roller -- Rolls 4d6 and removes lowest value. Provides 6 numbers to be assigned to ability scores.        
  Race           -- Randomly selects a race based from the core races in the Player's Handbook.        
  Class          -- Randomly selects a class based from the core classes in the Player's Handbook.
  Background     -- Randomly selects a background based from the backgrounds in the Player's Handbook.
  
# Planned Features:
  Save Characters -- Give the user the ability to save a character to reference later. Could be exported to a text file.     
  Subclass        -- Once class is generated, also randomly select a subclass.       
  Traits          -- Randomly select character traits based on background selected.     
  Equipment       -- Detail the equipment the character receives based on their class. Allow user selections where appropriate.     
  GUI             -- Grant the user a more accessible user interface.
